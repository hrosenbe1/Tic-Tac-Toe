#Tic Tac Toe


## Overview:

Tic Tac Toe is a two player game where one player is X and the other player is O. The board consists of 9 squares that each player can choose from. Only one square can be played at a time during a current game. Once a player has either all X's or O's in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally the game is over and a winner is declared.

## Project Notes:

I chose to make this game because this is my first app in Javascript/Jquery and thought it would be a good challenge for me. I initially experimented with image mapping but chose not to go that route due to the fact I wasn't pleased with the visual design. The only library in use is jQuery to speed development time.

##Technologies Used:

- Languages - HTML5, CSS3, Javascript/jQuery with DOM manipulation
- Design - Google Fonts, gliffy.com (wireframe), Adobe Photoshop
- Project Planning & User Stories - [Trello](https://trello.com/b/QtncqEOR/tic-tac-toe)
- Sublime Text 3

##Bonus Features:

- Each player can input their name and it will appear on screen where the score is kept
- The game automatically keeps score for each play and display is kept on screen until the Clear Score button is clicked
- After each game where there is a winner an audio file plays of a crowd cheering

##Future Developments:

- I would like to make this game responsive  
- I need to fix the New Game button bug if you hit New Game before a game is over
